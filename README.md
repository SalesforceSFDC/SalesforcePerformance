## Debug Log
A debug log records database operations, system processes, and errors that occur when executing a transaction or while running unit tests. The system generates a debug log for a user every time that user executes a transaction and the user has a trace flag with start and expiration dates that contain the transaction's start time. You can monitor and retain debug logs for the users specified below.

A debug level is a set of log levels for debug log categories: Database, Workflow, Validation, and so on. You can reuse debug levels across your trace flags.
